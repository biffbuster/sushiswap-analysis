# Sushiswap Analysis
____________

In this dashboard we will be monitoring Sushiswap activity from the Top Pools since the exploit on April 9th. For a quick overview, on April 9th, Sushiswap encountered suspicious activity within the protocol which had lead to an exploit of $3.3M.

The purpose of the real-time dashboard is to monitor and track the protocol since the incident and see if we can find a change in user behavior and usage.


# Methodology
_____

This dashboard was created using [Sentio](https://docs.sentio.xyz/) real time monitoring. Sentio provides modern monitoring, alerting and log management for decentralized applications as an integrated and hosted experience. 



# Analysis
___________

Our objectives are to monitor pool activity over the last 2 weeks. Keep in mind you can change the duration to 1 month for better viewing. We will be breaking our analysis down in 3 sections:

1. Pool Monitoring
2. Swap Activity
3. Lending Activity

To find our objective, we must first answer the following questions:

- Has pool volume changed since the exploit?
- Has lending / borrowing on Sushiswap been affected?
- Are DAU users increasing or decreasing? (WIP)
